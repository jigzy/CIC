	- Secure Rural Schools (SRS) - entire dataset
	- Public Welfare Expenditures -> "Total Public Welfare" indicator (either Total or Total Public Welfare)
	- County Profile - Fiscal Year End Date

		- Road Ownership - Unknown Road Mile
		- Road Ownership - Share Private

	- Health Insurance (check CIC data first)
		- missing share indicators
		- also may have to change age group (5-24 -> 5-14, 15-24)
		
	- Housing Units - Population (possible to delete)


NEEDS TO BE UPDATED IN DATABASE:
	- Population by Age and Gender
		- An older file was added into the database (years are different 5-24 -> 5-14, 15-24)
	- Public Elementary & Secondary Schools
		- An older file was added into the database (now divided by county instead of per district)
