One limits the overall property tax payment to a certain percentage of the propertyâ€™s market value. Another type restricts mill levies, or freezes mill levies. Local governments can usually override property tax rate limits with voter approval.  Assessment limits how much property values can increase annually for tax purposes. These limits can restrict a county from generating large increases in revenues from rapidly rising property values." class="btn" value="propTaxLimits" type="radio">State Limits on Property Tax</button>

					<button title="Local option gas tax is a tax collected by a loccal government on the sale of gasoline within their jurisdiction, if the local government is granted the authority by the state.  The revenues from this tax are used for transportation purposes.  Besides state authority, often the local government needs a local law or voter approval to implement the local option gas tax.  To be considered a local option gas tax in this study, the state authority to collect the tax must be granted to counties; statewide and state collected gas taxes that do not require local approval are considered state gas taxes." class="btn" value="localGasTax" type="radio">Local Gas Tax</button>
					<button title="Local option sales tax is a tax collected by a local government on the sale of any taxable goods within its jurisdiction, if the local government is granted the authority by the state.  Besides state authority, often the local government needs a local law or voter approval to implement the local option sales tax.  To be considered a local option sales tax in this study, the state authority to collect the tax must be granted to counties and the tax revenue used for transportation or for general purposes, including transportation.  A local option sales tax differs from a local option gas tax through the tax base; the local gas tax only applies to the sale of gasoline, whereas a local option sales tax applies to the sale of any taxable goods within the county." class="btn" value="localSalesTax" type="radio">Local Option Sales Tax</button>

Counties in four states (Delaware, North Carolina, Vermont and West Virginia) do not have authority over both roads and bridges.  New Hampshire counties do not own roads and only one county (Belknap County) owns a bridge.  Connecticut and Rhode Island do not have county governments and are not included in the study.
