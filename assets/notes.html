		<br>The 2015 County Health Rankings provide data for the older units Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area and Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area that have incorporated into the Petersburg Borough, City and Borough of Wrangell and Skagway Municipality. The County Explorer reports the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area data for both Petersburg Borough and the City and Borough of Wrangell and the Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area data for Skagway Municipality. </span>
	<span class="chr-note idio-note">
		<br>The 2015 County Health Rankings provide data at the New York City borough level.  County Explorer reports the indicators at New York City level. In case of the percentage indicators, the New York City value reflects an average of the borough-level data.</span>
	<span class="endangered-note idio-note">
		<br>The Number of Endangered and Threatened Species includes species classified as Endangered, Threatened, and Threatened due to Similarity of Appearance.</span>
	<span class="endangered-note idio-note">
		<br>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provide data for the older units of Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area and Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area that have incorporated into the Petersburg Borough, City and Borough of Wrangell and Skagway Municipality. We report the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area data for both Petersburg Borough and the City and Borough of Wrangell and the Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area data for Skagway Municipality.</span>
	<span class="unaccompaniedChildren-note idio-note">
		<br>Data includes counties where 50 or more children have been released for FY 2014.  This comprises 44,361 of the 53,518 total children released to sponsors in this period.</span>
	<span class="ancestry-note idio-note">
		<br>NACo provides the percentage of county residents by first ancestry based on the types of ancestry for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides public data.  They do not add up to 100 percent, as there are other first ancestry types that the U.S. Census Bureau reports collectively as “Other.” </span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note">
		<br>City/Town owned bridges are classified as county owned for consolidated city-county governments.</span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note">
		<br>Bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete using the "10 Year Rule,  which excludes bridges built or reconstructed within the past 10 years of being assigned a deficiency status since they are not generally eligible for Highway Bridge Program funding.</span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note">
		<br>The Federal Highway Administration provides data for the older units Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area and Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area that have incorporated into the Petersburg Borough, City and Borough of Wrangell and Skagway Municipality. The County Explorer reports the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area data for both Petersburg Borough and the City and Borough of Wrangell and the Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area data for Skagway Municipality.</span>
	<span class="county-jails-note idio-note">
		<br>A county jail is defined as a confinement facility that does not operate solely as a short-term holding or lockup facility (less than 72 hours).</span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note">
		<br>New York City Year-to-year export growth is an average of year-to-year export growth in each of NY's boroughs.</span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note">
		<br>The Brookings export estimates do not take into account different export propensities of county industries that produce similar shares of an industry’s national output.  This approach assumes that if a county produces 5 percent of the national value-added of computer manufacturing, then this county also exports 5 percent of U.S. computer and electronics.</span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note">
		<br>The Brookings export estimates employ Moody’s Analytics county level economic output (GDP) data.  Moody’s Analytics follows the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) definition of county economies, which combines small independent cities in VA (with populations smaller than 100,000 residents) with the county where the city is located. BEA also combines Maui and Kalawao County in Hawaii. For these special cases, the County Explorer reports data for the county and independent city combination.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note">
		<br>In 2013 Virginia implemented a comprehensive transportation bill, part of which was replacing the flat tax of 17.5 cents per wholesale gallon to a tax based on 3.5% of the wholesale price of gasoline.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note">
		<br>Florida's last state gas tax increase was in 1990 when the fuel sales tax was raised along with an additional fuel excise tax revision and other uses fees were imposed.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note">
		<br>New York's 8 cent per gallon motor fuel tax was established in 1972. Supplemental taxes (also known as the petroleum business taxes) were established in the 1980’s and replaced other forms of taxation on the petroleum industry. The last adjustment to these supplemental taxes occurred in 1995 to provide for indexing to inflation.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note">
		<br>The number of years since the last state gas tax increase does not reflect when the gas tax increase took effect, but the passage of state legislation that allowed for the increase.</span>
	<span class="coal-note idio-note">
		<br>A surface mine is a coal-producing mine that is usually within a few hundred feet of the surface. Earth above or around the coal (overburden) is removed to expose the coalbed, which is then mined with surface excavation equipment, such as draglines, powers hovels, bulldozers, loaders, and augers. It may also be known as an area, contour, open-pit, strip, or auger mine.  An undergroung mine is a mine where coal is produced by tunneling into the earth to the coalbed, which is then mined with underground mining equipment such as cutting machines and continuous, longwall, and shortwall mining machines. Underground mines are classified according to the type of opening used to reach the coal, i.e., drift (level tunnel), slope (inclined tunnel), or shaft (vertical tunnel).</span>
	<span class="coal-note idio-note">
		<br>A short ton is equal to 2000 pounds.  1 short ton is equal to 0.907184 metric tons.</span>
	<span class="coal-note idio-note">
		<br>A generator's energy source is regarded as coal if it is one of the following: anthracite coal; bituminous coal; lignite coal; subbituminous coal; coal-derived synthesis gas; waste/other coal (including anthracite culm, bituminous gob, fine coal, lignite waste, waste coal).</span>
	<span class="survey-of-jails-note idio-note">
		<br>N/A indicates the data are missing or not applicable. Data are missing for 222 counties. There are 407 counties that do not operate a county jail.</span>
	<span class="jails-agency-note idio-note">
		<br>If data is unavailable for a county, the Bureau of Justice Statistics did not include this county in the sample of 891 local jails surveyed in this year.
		<br>County jails data do not reflect city jails, county facilities that operate according to the regulations of the state department of corrections, or regional jails operated by a formal agreement among two or more counties .  Following the recommendations of the U.S Bureau of Justice Statistics, in cases where the county has more than one jail facility, County Explorer jail data reflect aggregates at the county level.</span>
	<span class="srs-note idio-note">
		<br>The receipts year reflects when the U.S. Forest Service collects revenues from national forest lands.
		<br/>Sixteen Oregon counties receive SRS payments from both the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Two Oregon counties only receive SRS payments from the Bureau of Land Mangement.</span>
	<span class="child-poverty-note idio-note">
		<br>Following the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive 14, the U.S. Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by household size, the age of the household members and presence of children in the family to determine poverty status. A family and every member of the family are living in poverty if a household’s total income is less than the family’s threshold in <a href=" https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html">Census Bureau’s table</a>. The official poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated for inflation using Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid and food stamps).</span>
	<span class="jails-pop-note idio-note">
		<br>If data is unavailable for a county, the Bureau of Justice Statistics did not include this county in the sample of 891 local jails surveyed in this year.
		<br>Map is based on a sample of jails selected by the Census Bureau.  Between years of the Census of Jails, which is a survey of all local jail facilities, the Census Bureau surveys a smaller, predetermined number of jail facilities.  A number of county jails are considered certainty jail jurisdictions, which are included in the sample because they have an average daily population (ADP) of 500 or more inmates and at least one juvenile inmate or have an ADP of 750 or more adult inmates.  Jails that are operated by two or more jurisdictions, such as regional jails, are also considered certainty jail jurisdictions.  When a jail does not meet the criteria of a certainty jail jurisdiction, it may be randomly selected and surveyed. The sample of jails is designed to be representative of all U.S. jail jurisdictions.
		<br>County jails data do not reflect city jails, county facilities that operate according to the regulations of the state department of corrections, or regional jails operated by a formal agreement among two or more counties. Following the recommendations of the U.S Bureau of Justice Statistics, in cases where the county has more than one jail facility, County Explorer jail data reflect aggregates at the county level.

	<span class="medical-benefits-note idio-note">
		<br>The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis does not report the total estimates of the public assistance medical care benefits received by residents of 2 counties (Borden County, TX and Loving County, Texas) and the total estimates less than $50,000 of the military medical insurance benefits received in 106 counties in 2013.   The County Explorer interactive shows these counties as not receiving benefits in 2013, given the low and undisclosed value of the benefits.</span>
	<span class="veterans-income-note idio-note">
		<br>Veterans Median Income is not available from the Census Bureau for King County, Texas and Loving County, Texas. Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate.</span>
	<span class="veterans-unem-note idio-note">
		<br>Veterans Unemployment Rate is not available from the Census Bureau for Loving County, Texas. Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate.</span>
	<span class="veterans-vahealthcare-note idio-note">
		<br>Veterans Affairs does not report exact figures if a county has fewer than 10 unique patients receiving treatment at a VA health care facility. This occurs in the following five counties: Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska; City and Borough of Yakutat, Alaska; Kenedy County, Texas; King County, Texas; and Loving County, Texas.</span>
	<span class="nursing-county-supported-note idio-note">
		<br>Nursing homes located within cities but supported by counties are attributed to the county supporting them.</span>
	<span class="nursing-percent-occupied-note idio-note">
		<br>Percent of occupied beds may be greater than 100%.  This may occur if counties have beds that are not certified as nursing home beds.  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not provide data on the nursing home presence in 217 counties with county governments. Therefore, the data for those counties is unavailable.</span>
	<span class="wdb-note idio-note">
		<br>Local WDBs refers to the group of individuals appointed by chief elected officials in a local area who are responsible for workforce development planning and activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). N/A indicates the information for the county is missing.
	<br>Sixty-five (65) counties in Alabama are served by the Alabama Governor’s Office of Workforce Development, which is a state-run board.</span>
	<span class="wioa-note idio-note">
		<br>The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) supports the public workforce system by providing funding for local workforce development activities. States receive formula based funding from the federal government.  States can reserve up to 15 percent of the allocation to support statewide activities.  The remaining share of funding is distributed to local workforce development boards (local WDB) using a formula specified in WIOA.  Local WDB refers to the group of individuals appointed by chief elected officials in a local area who are responsible for workforce development planning and activities under WIOA. Sixty-five (65) counties in Alabama are served by the Alabama Governor’s Office of Workforce Development, which is a state-run board. This map reflects only the service areas of local WDBs that cover counties with county governments. The dark grey areas in Conn., R.I., parts of Alaska, Mass. and Va. are counties or county-equivalents without county governments.</span>
	<span class="drug-poisoning-note idio-note">
		<br>Drug-poisoning deaths include those that are unintentional, suicide, homicide, or of undetermined intent, by and exposure to: nonopioid analgesics, antipyretics and antirheumatics; antiepileptic, sedative-hypnotic, antiparkinsonism and psychotropic drugs, not elsewhere classified; narcotics and psychodysleptics [hallucinogens], not elsewhere classified; other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system; and other and unspecified drugs, medicaments and biological substances.  The drug poisoning death rate is the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) estimated number of deaths resulting from drug poisoning per 100,000 individuals. The estimated rate takes into account the variation of the drug poisoning death by age in the county, eliminating age effects that would skew the drug poisoning death rate. The drug poisoning death rate for New York City is the median rate of the five boroughs.

	<span class="census-of-govs-employment-note idio-note">
		<br>Data are available for county governments surveyed by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014.  Census employs a two-stage sampling method.  In the first stage, the sample design is stratified probability proportional to size (PPS). In the second stage, a modified cut-off sample method was used to reduce the number of small townships and special districts.  At the time of sample selection, there were 90,690 local governments on the sampling frame.  Survey data are subject to sampling and non-sampling variability. Full-time employees are persons whose hours of work represent full-time employment in their employing government.  Part-time employees are persons who work less than the standard number of hours of full-time work in their employing government.</span>
