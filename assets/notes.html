	<span class="ancestry-note idio-note"><br>NACo provides the percentage of county residents by first ancestry based on the types of ancestry for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides public data.  They do not add up to 100 percent, as there are other first ancestry types that the U.S. Census Bureau reports collectively as “Other.” </span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note"><br>City/Town owned bridges are classified as county owned for consolidated city-county governments.</span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note"><br>Bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete using the "10 Year Rule,  which excludes bridges built or reconstructed within the past 10 years of being assigned a deficiency status since they are not generally eligible for Highway Bridge Program funding.</span>
	<span class="bridges-note idio-note"><br>The Federal Highway Administration provides data for the older units Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area and Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area that have incorporated into the Petersburg Borough, City and Borough of Wrangell and Skagway Municipality.

	<span class="county-jails-note idio-note"><br>Alaska has a unified jail and prison system, where the State of Alaska Department of Corrections operates jails. </span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note"><br>New York City Year-to-year export growth is an average of year-to-year export growth in each of NY's boroughs.</span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note"><br>The Brookings export estimates do not take into account different export propensities of county industries that produce similar shares of an industry’s national output.  This approach assumes that if a county produces 5 percent of the national value-added of computer manufacturing, then this county also exports 5 percent of U.S. computer and electronics.</span>
	<span class="exports-note idio-note"><br>The Brookings export estimates employ Moody’s Analytics county level economic output (GDP) data.  Moody’s Analytics follows the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) definition of county economies, which combines small independent cities in VA (with populations smaller than 100,000 residents) with the county where the city is located. BEA also combines Maui and Kalawao County in Hawaii. For these special cases, the County Explorer reports data for the county and independent city combination.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note"><br>In 2013 Virginia implemented a comprehensive transportation bill, part of which was replacing the flat tax of 17.5 cents per wholesale gallon to a tax based on 3.5% of the wholesale price of gasoline.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note"><br>Florida's last state gas tax increase was in 1990 when the fuel sales tax was raised along with an additional fuel excise tax revision and other uses fees were imposed.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note"><br>New York's 8 cent per gallon motor fuel tax was established in 1972. Supplemental taxes (also known as the petroleum business taxes) were established in the 1980’s and replaced other forms of taxation on the petroleum industry. The last adjustment to these supplemental taxes occurred in 1995 to provide for indexing to inflation.</span>
	<span class="state-trans-note idio-note"><br>The number of years since the last state gas tax increase does not reflect when the gas tax increase took effect, but the passage of state legislation that allowed for the increase.</span>
